 *  Entity recorder for Akka Routers. The metrics being tracked are:

 *    - time-in-mailbox: Time spent from the instant when a message is enqueued in a actor's mailbox to the instant when
 *      that message is dequeued for processing.
 *    - processing-time: Time taken for the actor to process the receive function.
 *    - errors: Number or errors seen by the actor's supervision mechanism.
