Everything starts with an idea, and [this](https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon/graphs/contributors) guys are helping us
take that idea and make it a reality. A reality that is helping developers around the world to measure and monitor their
success with reactive technologies. Kudos to all of you!


Our users
---------

It is absolutely rewarding to know that Kamon is useful for people around the world, and it is even better when these
people come to us looking for help, reporting issues, giving feedback or telling us how smoothly Kamon is monitoring
their production systems, thanks for using Kamon! keep coming and spread the word :).



[YourKit, LLC](http://www.yourkit.com)
--------------------------------------

We care a lot about performance and we try hard to keep Kamon's overhead as low as possible, but we couldn't succeed on
this matter without [YourKit's Java Profiler](http://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/index.jsp). It is well known to be
one of the best profilers out there and they have been so kind to support us by providing a open source use license to
Kamon developers. Thanks YourKit! We highly appreciate your support and commitment to the open source community.
